Files for a Flames n Stuff video

This repository contains the 3D files used in my Impact-Triggered Hydrogen Bottle Rocket video on YouTube.

Components
Main Body
This is the large central part of the build. It gives the rocket its weight. There's a hollow section inside where you can add extra weight if needed.

Safety Cap
This is the top part that allows you to switch the device into a "safe" mode by rotating it.

Balloon Sleeve
This part holds a balloon securely in place. It's designed to work with standard party balloons.

PCO 1881 Thread
This is a standard bottle thread. It may not match your bottle, so if you're using a different one...-->

Igniter Threads
These let you adapt the design to fit different bottle types. You can either find or model your own bottle threads and combine them with the igniter threads provided here.
